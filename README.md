Introduction
------------

Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) is a widely used technique in computer graphics, machine learning, and computational geometry to reduce the size of a point cloud while preserving the overall structure. This Python implementation provides a fast and efficient way to perform FPS on large datasets without the need to compute all pairs of distances.

Installation
------------

To use this library, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/yotamnahum/farthest-point-sampling.git`

Once the repository is cloned, you can import the `farthest_point_sampling` function from the main file in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

pythonCopy code

`from farthest_point_sampling import farthest_point_sampling`

Usage Examples
--------------

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the `farthest_point_sampling` function:

### Basic Usage

pythonCopy code

`import numpy as np from farthest_point_sampling import farthest_point_sampling  data = np.random.rand(100, 1024) point_idx = farthest_point_sampling(data, 3)  print(point_idx) # Output: array([80, 79, 27])`

### Specifying a Starting Point

pythonCopy code

`import numpy as np from farthest_point_sampling import farthest_point_sampling  data = np.random.rand(100, 1024) point_idx = farthest_point_sampling(data, 5, start_idx=60)  print(point_idx) # Output: array([60, 39, 59, 21, 73])`

Feel free to experiment with different datasets and tweak the parameters to achieve the desired level of point cloud reduction. This efficient implementation makes it easy to incorporate Farthest Point Sampling into your projects for improved performance and resource usage.
